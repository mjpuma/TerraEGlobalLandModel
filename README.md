# TerraEGlobalLandModel
The TerraE Global Land Model ("TerraE") simulates water and heat transport on a global grid for a set of land tiles within each grid cell.  Currently, we have one tile for bare soil and one for vegetation (assuming both exist within a grid cell).  For each tile, we have a discretized soil column.  The default setup in ModelE2.1 (and previous versions back to at least the 1990s) had a column that extends to a depth of 3.5 m.  Each of these soil columns is discretized into six vertical layers; the layer thicknesses are 0.1 m, 0.17 m, 0.30 m, 0.51 m, 0.89 m and 1.53 m (Abramopoulos et al., 1988; Rosenzweig and Abramopoulos, 1997). 
ModelE3 features a land column with the following layering (bottom layer depths): 0.05 m, 0.14 m, 0.30 m, 0.587 m, 1.102m, 2.024 m, 3.676 m, 6.635 m, 11.936 m, 21.431 m. The soils are characterized by new texture data from De Lannoy et al. (2014), new data on land-surface slope (add ref), and new depth-to-bedrock data based on Pelletier et al. (2016).  The deeper land column together with the depth-to-bedrock information allow us to implement groundwater in the model.
